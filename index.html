        <h1>Internet Censorship LOR Question</h1>
        <h3>Plan</h3>
        <p> Knowledge - Censorship is the act of content on the internet being prohibited or blocked from access as it goes against certain rules or guidlines so people can't upload or public certain material. 
            <br> Application - Censorship is needed for things like radicalism, terrorism, pornography and extreme violence. However, it is also used sometimes to silence people on the internet which goes against freedom of speech in some way so it's about finding the right balance.
             <br> Evaluation - I think that censorship is definitely needed as people who are exposed to the wrong thing on social media or the internet can be impacted detrimentally in real life making them make poor decisions and effect society in a negative way.

        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>Censorship is the act of prohibiting something or blocking access to something. Therefore, internet censorship is the act of prohibiting access to certain posts or websites on the internet as it violates certain rules or guidelines. This is usually done for the benefit of everyone but it's not always like that. Examples of sites that are banned may be pornography, terrorism, radicalism and criminal activities. Internet service providers and mobile data service providers often use censorship to stop people from searching things like this. <br> <br> 
            However, governments can also use censorship for bad, unethical reasons. For example, China censoring the Tiananmen Square massacre. This was a student led protest for democracy in the country. It ended in police officers killing the protestors. So, the Chinese Government censored this as it displays a negative view of them. <br> <br> In conclusion, Internet Censorship can be good and bad, but I think the benefits outweigh the negatives by a long shot even though it can be used for very unethical reasons. It's better than letting people use the internet in anyway they like in my opinion.</p>
